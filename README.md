# Hi there! I'm Daniel Cruz, a skilled data engineer. 👋

[![GitHub followers](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/DanielCruzDataEngineer.svg?style=social)](https://github.com/DanielCruzDataEngineer?tab=followers)

I have extensive experience designing and building efficient and scalable data pipelines using technologies such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and AWS services. I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive better decision-making through ETL (extract, transform, load) processes.

My expertise in designing and implementing data models and schemas optimized for analytics enables me to deliver top-quality work. I am also well-versed in working with SQL databases and can create complex queries and procedures to help you make the most of your data.

If you're looking for a data engineer to help you turn raw data into meaningful insights, look no further! I'm confident in my abilities and would love to discuss your project in more detail.
